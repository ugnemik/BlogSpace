# BlogSpace

This is a small project to practice API.

Built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

This blog app uses the JSON placeholder API to get fake blog entries. I have included a form that allows you to create a new blog post with a title and body that will appear above previous posts.

To post, the user must fill out both the title and the body.
